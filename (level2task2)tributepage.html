                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Born on March 17, 1962, in the city of Karnal in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. 
                    She was born to Banarasi Lal Chawla, who was a businessman, and Sanjyothi Chawla, who was a social worker.
                    She had a difficult upbringing due to the fact that she was the youngest daughter. 
                    From the time she was a baby, she was referred to as Montu by her parents. Upon entering school, Chawla was the first in her family to choose her own name.
                    A person's "thought" or "imagination" is represented by the name 'Kalpana'. K.C. was a moniker she used to go by. Flying, trekking, backpacking, 
                    and reading were some of her favorite activities.
                    It was 1997 when Kalpana Chawla became the first Indian woman in space, breaking ground for future generations. As a result of Columbia's destruction on February 1, 2003, Chawla was killed. Upon re-entry, 
                    the spacecraft split apart, killing all seven people inside. After her death, Chawla's legacy has been preserved. 
                    This is the story of extraordinary talent who, through her dedication and hard work, was able to realize her aspirations and 
                    become an inspiration to young people in India and throughout the globe.

                <h3>2nd space mission/Death</h3>
                <P>
                In 2000, Chawla was selected for her second flight as part of the crew of STS-107. This mission was repeatedly delayed due to scheduling conflicts
                and technical problems such as the July 2002 discovery of cracks in the shuttle engine flow liners. On 16 January 2003, Chawla finally returned
                to space aboard Space Shuttle Columbia on the ill-fated STS-107 mission. The crew performed nearly 80 experiments studying Earth and space science
                advanced technology development, and astronaut health and safety.
                Chawla died on 1 February 2003, in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, along with the other six crew members, when Columbia disintegrated over Texas 
                during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, shortly before it was scheduled to conclude its 28th mission, STS-107. Her remains were identified 
                along with those of the rest of the crew members and were cremated and scattered at Zion National Park in Utah in accordance with her wishes.
